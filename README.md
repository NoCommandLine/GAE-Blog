# GAE Blog
A Google App Engine-based blog application 

 - Built with Python 3.9+ and Flask 
 - Data is stored in Google Cloud Datastore (a.k.a Firestore in Datastore Mode)

## Setup 
1. Clone the repo or download the source as a zipped file and unzip it to a folder
2. If you're using the GAE GUI - [NoCommandLine](https://nocommandline.com/), then follow the steps to add an existing project 

    a. File > Add Existing Application 
    
    b. In the Application Path, use the file widget to navigate to the folder from bullet 'a' and select the `app.yaml` file 
    
    c. Provide a new name for your App 
    
    d. Click the 'Add' button 

    e. Open `main.py` and update the port number to the value auto generated by `NoCommandLine` (the value in the 'Port' Column) 
    
    f. Finally, click the 'Run' icon. This will install the requirements from the requirements.txt file and start the App.
    
3. If you're not using the GAE GUI - [NoCommandLine](https://nocommandline.com/)

    a. Open a terminal window 
    
    b. Change directory to the folder where you unzipped the project i.e. `$cd <project_path>` 
    
    c. Create and activate a virtual env
    
    - `python3 -m venv env` 
    - `source env/bin/activate`
    
    d. Install the requirements 
    
    - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
